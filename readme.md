The project is ready to run in Android Studio.

please enter your Tmdb Api-Key in local.properties file
in the following format:
`TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`

The main screen of the project is the Genres screen.
I created the Home screen to show the usage of Navigation in Jetpack Compose,
And to have some fun with the search bar :)
